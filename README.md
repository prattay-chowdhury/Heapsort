# Heapsort

What does the program do?
1. The program prints hardcoded array of 16 elements. First element contains array index of last element and rest of the 15 elements are unsorted integer data.
2. Then the program uses floyd's alogrithm to create a min heap and the new array is printed.
3. After that the program performs heapsort to sort the integers in descending order. The sorted array is printed and first elements shows 0 as sorting is done.
